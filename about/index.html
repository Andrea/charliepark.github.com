<h2>About</h2>

<p>The Setup is a collection of nerdy interviews, asking people from all walks of life about the <strong>software</strong> and <strong>hardware</strong> they use.</p>
<p>Despite appearances, the site is <em>not</em> actually sponsored by Apple - people just seem to like using their tools. We're a fan, too.</p>

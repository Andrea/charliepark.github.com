<p>Hey there. I&rsquo;m Charlie. I make stuff.</p>

<p><strong>I run a few small web-based businesses that make the world better.</strong> One of them &mdash; <a href="https://pearbudget.com/">PearBudget</a> &mdash; helps people manage their money. Another &mdash; <a href="https://monotask.com/">Monotask</a> &mdash; helps people manage their attention. I made those tools because I needed them myself. Apparently, a lot of other people do, too.</p>

<p>I live in Virginia with my wife and three daughters, in a house I built. (Well &mdash; I GC&rsquo;d it.) Here&rsquo;s where I work:</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>Apart from my businesses, I work on a number of distractions that both improve and interfere with my work. You can see them over at the <a href="/projects">projects page</a>. The one I use the most, myself, is <a href="http://charliepark.org/rightnow">Right Now</a>.</p>

<h3>Elsewhere Online</h3>

<p>I post <strong>quotes, articles, and links on attention management</strong> over at <a href="http://attnmgmtblog.com">The Attention Management Blog</a>.</p>

<p>I post <strong>neat things I find online</strong> to my tumblelog, at <a href="http://charliepark.tumblr.com">charliepark.tumblr.com</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on <strong>Twitter</strong>. Frankly, when people say &ldquo;you should follow me on Twitter&rdquo;, it pisses me off. So I&rsquo;m not going to tell you what to do. If you want to see my account, though, it&rsquo;s at <a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark/">@charliepark</a>.

<p><strong>Things to read later</strong> are at Instapaper (but I can&rsquo;t figure out how to link to my stream right now).</p>

<p><strong>Bookmarks</strong> are at <a href="http://www.pinboard.in/u:charliepark">Pinboard</a>.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>Twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/charliepark">@charliepark</a>) or e-mail (<a href="mailto:charlie@pearbudget.com">charlie@pearbudget.com</a>) are the best ways to reach me.</p>

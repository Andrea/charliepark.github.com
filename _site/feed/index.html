				<p>When I decided to convert my blog over to Jekyll, I was pretty excited about it. It seemed to offer the right balance between power and simplicity.</p>

<p>I realized pretty soon, though, that one of the main features I wanted to implement &#8211; tagging &#8211; isn&#8217;t well-supported in Jekyll.</p>

<p>I figured out how to get it working, though, and wanted to share what I came up with.</p>

<h2 id='the_problem'>The Problem</h2>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t support tagging. It does. In the sense that you can add tags to a post.</p>

<p>But one of the necessary pages on a blog with tags is the tag archive page, where the blog automatically collects all posts tagged with &#8220;rails&#8221; or &#8220;experiments&#8221; or &#8220;recipes&#8221; or whatever.</p>

<p>For some reason, Jekyll doesn&#8217;t automatically produce those pages.</p>

<h2 id='the_process'>The Process</h2>

<p>I looked at a number of different blogs, and at the source code for a number of different Jekyll-powered blogs. I also poked around at Stack Overflow and Google Groups. They were useful in that they pointed me in the right direction. But all assumed more familiarity with Jekyll than I have, or they had some other issue that prevented my &#8220;getting it&#8221;.</p>

<p>Eventually, I figured out how to make it work, mainly by abusing some &#8220;Categories in Jekyll&#8221; code that others had put online. My approach ended up being almost identical to some code &#8211; http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/105/index.html</p>

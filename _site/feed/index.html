				<p>There are often times when I can handle a programming issue in one of two (or more) ways. Dealing with Time / Date objects is one of those situations.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to know what day today is, you can either fetch Date.today.day or Time.now.day.</p>

<p>In my head, Date is a much simpler concept than Time. After all, Time deals with things like milliseconds and Epochs and things like that, where Date &#8230; well, I woke up this morning, and it was today&#8217;s date. And when I get up tomorrow, it&#8217;ll be tomorrow&#8217;s date. &#8220;Date&#8221; seems much more tangible.</p>

<p>I was curious, though, to know if there was a difference in how quickly Ruby could process the two. So I ran a test.</p>

<h3 id='the_first_test'>The First Test</h3>

<p>I was in a Rails app, so I fired up script/console, and added the following code:</p>

<pre><code>require &#39;benchmark&#39;

Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { puts Time.now } }

Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { puts Date.today } }</code></pre>

<h3 id='the_results'>The Results</h3>

<p>What I found was really interesting.</p>

<p>I ran the test a couple of times, and the average processing time for Time.now was 104 ms. The average processing time for Date.today was 251 ms.</p>

<p>That means it took Date.today about two and a half times as long to get processed than Time.now.</p>

<h3 id='the_second_test'>The Second Test</h3>

<p>I was curious to see if those results would hold if I ran a more complicated test. So I made the processing a tiny bit trickier:</p>

<pre><code>def month_name_t(month = Time.now.month)
  Date::MONTHNAMES[month]
end
Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { month_name_t } }

def month_name_d(month = Date.today.month)
  Date::MONTHNAMES[month]
end
Benchmark.ms { 1000.times { month_name_d } }</code></pre>

<h3 id='more_results'>More Results</h3>

<p>This time around, the difference was even more pronounced.</p>

<p>On average, month_name_t (Time.now) took 2 ms. And month_name_d (Date.today) took 80 ms.</p>

<p>So when we made the function just a bit more complex, it increased the processing time dramatically: <strong>Date.today took 40 times as long to process as Time.now.</strong></p>

<h3 id='the_conclusion'>The Conclusion</h3>

<p><strong>When you&#8217;re processing Times and Dates in your app, and you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to use the Date object for some reason, use Time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> At the moment, I'm having no trouble geting Jekyll to render this locally. It seems to be having trouble over at Github. If I can figure out why, I'll let you know. For now, though, it's ... um ... not working.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2:</strong> Apparently, <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/325'>Github disables plugins.</a> You can still generate the site locally, commit it to your repo, and Github will serve it up.</p>
</div>
<p>When I decided to convert my blog over to Jekyll, I was pretty excited about it. It seemed to offer the right balance between power and simplicity.</p>

<p>I realized pretty soon, though, that one of the main features I wanted to implement &#8211; tagging &#8211; isn&#8217;t well-supported in Jekyll.</p>

<p>I figured out how to get it working, though, and wanted to share what I came up with.</p>

<h2 id='the_problem'>The Problem</h2>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t say that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t support tagging. It does. In the sense that you can add tags to a post.</p>

<p>But one of the necessary pages on a blog with tags is the tag archive page, where the blog automatically collects all posts tagged with &#8220;rails&#8221; or &#8220;experiments&#8221; or &#8220;recipes&#8221; or whatever.</p>

<p>For some reason, Jekyll doesn&#8217;t automatically produce those pages.</p>

<h2 id='the_process'>The Process</h2>

<p>I looked at a number of different blogs, and at the source code for a number of different Jekyll-powered blogs. I also poked around at Stack Overflow and Google Groups. They were useful in that they pointed me in the right direction. But all assumed more familiarity with Jekyll than I have, or they had some other issue that prevented my &#8220;getting it&#8221;.</p>

<p>Eventually, I figured out how to make it work, mainly by abusing some &#8220;Categories in Jekyll&#8221; code that others had put online. My approach ended up being almost identical to some code I found at <a href='http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/105/index.html'>http://brizzled.clapper.org/id/105/index.html</a>. In fact, I might have inadvertently lifted his code wholesale.</p>

<p>But nowhere in my escapades of ignorance did I find anyone who had written up an explanation of exactly what to do, where. So here you go.</p>

<h2 id='the_solution'>The Solution</h2>

<p>Jekyll recognizes tags out of the box. In your post&#8217;s <abbr>YAML</abbr> frontmatter, add tags like this:</p>

<pre><code>tags:
- jekyll
- code</code></pre>

<p>That sets up the post to have tags. To get the tags pulled onto a page, create two files:</p>

<pre><code>_layouts/tag_index.html</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>_plugins/_tag_gen.rb</code></pre>

<p>You probably already have a layouts directory, but you might need to add the plugins one. The tag_index.html file is necessary for the tag_gen.rb script to actually run.</p>

<p>In the tag_index file, put this:</p>

<pre><code>---
layout: default
---
&lt;h2 class=&quot;post_title&quot;&gt;Tags In Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  {.% for post in site.posts %}
  {.% for tag in post.tags %}
  {.% if tag == page.tag %}
  &lt;li class=&quot;archive_list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;time style=&quot;color:#666;font-size:11px;&quot; datetime=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;/time&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;archive_list_article_link&quot; href=&#39;&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;tag_list&quot;&gt;
      
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  {.% endif %}
  {.% endfor %}
  {.% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: In some of the lines up there, it has a &#8220;{.%&#8221; &#8230; get rid of that period between the curly bracket and the percent sign.</em></p>

<p><strong>What that does:</strong> When this page is created (more on that in a sec), it&#8217;ll have a specific tag assigned to it. That is, multiple pages will be created, each with their own official tag. This goes through every post in the site, and if the post has a tag that matches the tag for the page that&#8217;s being generated, the post is then listed, along with its publication date and summary. Obviously, if your posts don&#8217;t include a summary, you can leave that line off. Or, if there&#8217;s some other bit of metadata you want to include, you can add it into the layout.</p>

<p>In the tag_gen file. put this:</p>

<pre><code>module Jekyll
  class TagIndex &lt; Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, tag)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = &#39;index.html&#39;
      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, &#39;_layouts&#39;), &#39;tag_index.html&#39;)
      self.data[&#39;tag&#39;] = tag
      tag_title_prefix = site.config[&#39;tag_title_prefix&#39;] || &#39;Posts Tagged &amp;ldquo;&#39;
      tag_title_suffix = site.config[&#39;tag_title_suffix&#39;] || &#39;&amp;rdquo;&#39;
      self.data[&#39;title&#39;] = &quot;#{tag_title_prefix}#{tag}#{tag_title_suffix}&quot;
    end
  end
  class TagGenerator &lt; Generator
    safe true
    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? &#39;tag_index&#39;
        dir = site.config[&#39;tag_dir&#39;] || &#39;tag&#39;
        site.tags.keys.each do |tag|
          write_tag_index(site, File.join(dir, tag), tag)
        end
      end
    end
    def write_tag_index(site, dir, tag)
      index = TagIndex.new(site, site.source, dir, tag)
      index.render(site.layouts, site.site_payload)
      index.write(site.dest)
      site.pages &lt;&lt; index
    end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p><strong>What that does:</strong> Essentially, it creates a directory (folder) for each tag in your blog, and creates an index.html file in it. In that index.html file, it plugs in that template we just set up a few minutes ago. For the page title, it&#8217;ll combine the variables &#8220;tag_title_prefix&#8221; and &#8220;tag_title_suffix&#8221;, flanking the tag itself.</p>

<h2 id='thats_it'>That&#8217;s It</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m still learning a lot about Jekyll, and the liquid templating system. But I thought this might be useful to some of you who are considering Jekyll, but for whom tags are a deal-breaker. My entire site is at <a href='http://github.com/charliepark/charliepark.github.com'>http://github.com/charliepark/charliepark.github.com</a>, so if you want to see how I&#8217;m using it (or any tweaks I&#8217;ve made since posting this), you can check them out there.</p>
